title: "OWASP Top 10: XSS"
---

# Topic Introduction

This week we will be looking Cross Site Scripting.

This is another topic high in the OWASP top 10,  and is still very relevant
today.


XSS is where an attacker is able to Inject Javascript (or other client side code) into a page.
When a victim visits the page, the client side code executes in their browser.  
This can have a range of effects from minor irritation (popping an alert box), to full account takeover.


It is my belief that regardless of filtering systems, or input sanitisation
methods, XSS is going to be around for a long time.  So much of the web relies
on people being able to send / receive messages, that displaying user input will
never go away (and thus the potential mistakes in sanitising it remain)
